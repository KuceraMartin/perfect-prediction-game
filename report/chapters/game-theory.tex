\begin{lemma}
	For every game $G$, there exists at least one individually rational strategy profile.
	In other words, $\mathcal{S}_1(G) \ne \emptyset$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	For every player $i \in P$ we denote $m_i = \text{arg} \max_{t_i \in S_i} \min_{\vect_{-i} \in S_{-i}} u_i(t_i, \vect_{-i}) \in S_i$ the strategy that lower-bounds utility of player $i$.
	We claim that the strategy profile $\mm = (m_1, \dots, m_n) \in S$ is individually rational.
	If $\mm$ was not individually rational, there would have to be some player $j \in P$ and a strategy $s_j^* \in S_j$ that would ensure a better worst-case payoff: $\min_{\vecs_{-j} \in S_{-j}}u_j(s_j^*, \vecs_{-j}) > u_j(\mm)$ which would contradict the choice of $m_j$.
\end{proof}

\section{General games without ties}

\begin{observation}
	\label{th:pte-subset-ir}
	If a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ has a PTE $\vecs \in S$, then $\vecs$ is individually rational.
	However, not every individually rational profile is a PTE.
	In other words, if we think of PTE and IR as sets of strategy profiles in any given game, we have PTE $\subsetneq$ IR.
\end{observation}

\begin{definition}[Perfectly transparent best response]
	For a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ we say a strategy $s_i^* \in S_i$ is a perfectly transparent best response to a strategy profile $\vecs_{-i}$ of the opponent players if it is the Nashian best response to $\vecs_{-i}$ across all profiles that survive the maximum number of preemption rounds before all possible profiles are eliminated.
	Formally, there is some $k \in \N$ such that $(s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}) \in \mathcal{S}_k$, and $(s_i, \vecs_{-i}) \notin \mathcal{S}_{k+1} \forall s_i \in S_i$, and
	\[
		u_i(s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}) \ge u_i(s_i', \vecs_{-i})\ \forall (s_i', \vecs_{-i}) \in \mathcal{S}_k.
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Perfectly transparent best response equilibrium]
	We say a strategy profile $\vecs = (s_1, \dots, s_n) \in S$ is a perfectly transparent best response equilibrium (PTBRE) if $s_i$ is a perfectly transparent best response to $\vecs_{-i}$ for all players $i \in P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{observation}
	\label{th:tbre-subset-pte}
	If a strategy profile is a PTE, then it must be a PTBRE; we have PTE $\subset$ PTBRE.
\end{observation}

\begin{remark}
	The other inclusion does not hold: PTBRE $\not\subseteq$ PTE.
	A counterexample is displayed in \autoref{tab:pte-ne-ptbre}.
	Thus, we have PTE $\subsetneq$ PTBRE.

\begin{lemma}
	For any game $G = (P, S, \uu)$, if a strategy profile $\vecs \in S$ is a PTBRE, then it is individually rational.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let us suppose that there is a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ and a strategy profile $\vecs = (s_1, \dots, s_n) \in S$ such that $\vecs$ is a PTBRE but not individually rational.
	This is equivalent to $s_i$ being a perfectly transparent best response to $\vecs_{-i}$ for all $i \in P$, and $\vecs \notin \mathcal{S}_1$.
	Note that we must also have $(s_i', \vecs_{-i}) \notin \mathcal{S}_1\ \forall s_i' \in S_i,\ \forall i \in P$ because otherwise $s_i$ would not be a perfectly transparent best response to $\vecs_{-i}$ for some player $i$.
	This means the perfetcly transparent best response of every player $i \in P$ to $\vecs_{-i}$ is simply a Nashian best response (since all considered strategy profiles are eliminated in the same preemption round).
	Thus, $\vecs$ is a Nash equilibrium, which is always individually rational.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Perfectly transparent $i$-best profile]
	For a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ and player $i \in P$ we say a strategy profile $\vecs = (s_1, \dots, s_n) \in S$ is a perfectly transparent $i$-best profile if
	$s_i$ is a perfectly transparent best response to $\vecs_{-i}$ and $u_i(\vecs) \ge u_i(b(\vecs'_{-i}), \vecs'_{-i})$ for all opponent profiles $\vecs'_{-i}$ where $b(\vecs'_{-i})$ is the perfectly transparent best response to $\vecs'_{-i}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Perfectly transparent best profile equilibrium]
	We say a strategy profile $\vecs \in S$ is a perfectly transparent best profile equilibrium (PTBPE) if $\vecs$ is a perfectly transparent $i$-best profile for all $i \in P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	If a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ has a PTBPE $\vecs \in S$, then $\vecs$ is also a PTE, i.e., we have the inclusion PTBPE $\subset$ PTE.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	For the sake of deriving a contradiction, suppose that there is a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ with a strategy profile $\vecs = (s_1, \dots, s_n) \in S$ such that $\vecs$ is a PTBPE but not a PTE and let $k$ be the last preemption round in which $\vecs$ is not eliminated (i.e., $\vecs \in \mathcal{S}_k$ but $\vecs \notin \mathcal{S}_{k+1}$).
	Because $\vecs$ is eliminated in the $(k+1)$\textsuperscript{st} round, there must be some player $i \in P$ with a strategy $s_i^* \ne s_i$ which causes the elimination:
	\[
		\forall \vecs_{-i}' \in S_{-i}: (s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}') \in \mathcal{S}_k \implies u_i(s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}') > u_i(\vecs).
	\]
	Let $\vecs_{-i}^* \in S_{-i}$ such that $(s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}^*)\in \mathcal{S}_k$ (there must be at least one to cause $\vecs \notin \mathcal{S}_{k+1}$).
	We have $u_i(s_i^*, \vecs_{-i}^*) > u_i(\vecs)$ which means $s_i$ is not a perfectly transparent best response of player $i$ to $\vecs_{-i}$, so $\vecs$ is not a perfectly transparent $i$-best profile, contradicting $\vecs$ being a PTBPE.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Since PTBPE $\subset$ PTE, we have
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PTBPE $\subsetneq$ IR (by \autoref{th:pte-subset-ir}), and
		\item PTBPE $\subsetneq$ PTBRE (by \autoref{th:tbre-subset-pte}).
	\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

	The other inclusion does not hold: PTE $\not\subseteq$ PTBPE.
	A counterexample is displayed in \autoref{tab:pte-ne-ptbpe}.

\section{Symmetric games without ties}

\begin{observation}
	 In a symmetric game $G = (P, S, \uu)$, if a strategy profile $\vecs \in S$ is a PTE, then it lies on the diagonal, i.e., we have $\vecs = (a, a, \dots, a)$ for some strategy $a$.
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}
	If there was a PTE somewhere else than on the diagonal, we would necessarily have multiple PTEs by symmetry, contradicting the uniqueness of PTE.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If a symmetric game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ has a PTE $\vecs \in S$ and $\vecs$ is the perfectly transparent $i$-best profile for some player $i \in P$, then $\vecs$ is a PTBPE. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Since $\vecs$ is on the diagonal and it is the perfectly transparent $i$-best profile for some $i \in P$, by symmetry, it must actually be the perfectly transparent $j$-best profile for all $j \in P$, which is the definition of PTBPE.
\end{proof}

\begin{conjecture}
	PTE = PTBPE.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{lemma}
	In a symmetric game $G = (P, S, \uu)$, if a strategy profile $\vecs \in S$ is a PTE, then it is minimax rationalizable.
	Thus, we have PTE\textsuperscript{sym} $\subset$ MR.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose for the sake of deriving a contradiction that there is a game $G = (P, S, \uu)$ and a strategy profile $\vecs \in S$ that is a PTE but not minimax rationalizable.
	By definition, this means that there is some player $i \in P$ such that $(s_i, \vecs_{-i}')$ is not minimax rationalizable for any $\vecs' \in S$.
	By symmetry, if this statement holds for one player, then it must hold for all players.
	Let $s_j$ be the strategy that minimax-dominates $s_i$ (i.e. causes that $s_i$ is not minimax rationalizable).
	We denote $\vecs^* = (s_j, s_j, \dots, s_j)$.
	In the round where strategy $s_i$ is eliminated, strategy profile $\vecs^*$ must survive---otherwise strategy $s_j$ would be eliminated as well, but we supposed that $s_j$ is the strategy that caused the elimination of $s_i$.
	Moreover, we must have $u_i(\vecs^*) > u_i(\vecs)\ \forall i \in P$ because $s_j$ minimax-dominates $s_i$.
	This means $\vecs$ is not Pareto-optimal which contradicts $\vecs$ being a PTE.
\end{proof}
