\chapter{Conclusion}
Our work presents a functional implementation of a backend engine for playing games in normal form against a computer.
Besides that, we have defined several new notions of equilibria: perfectly transparent best response equilibrium, perfectly transparent best profile equilibrium, and perfectly transparent optimal profile equilibrium.
With the help of our analysis of randomly generated datasets, we have determined the inclusion relations between these equilibria, and between individal rationality and minimax rationalizibility.

The next step in training people for non-Nashian thinking will be to develop a more user-friendly client for the backend, such as a mobile app.
Subsequently, the app can be used to conduct experiments.
Our backend will store the results of all games played in a database for future analysis.
