abstract = {The dynamic evolutionary stability of mutual defection is proven for the repeated prisoner 's dilemma game where payoffs are cumulative and the number of repetitions is known. This agrees with the classical result that the only Nash equilibrium outcome is to defect at all stages of this repeated game. Moreover, it is shown that, for any initial polymorphic population, the evolutionary dynamic converges to a unique Nash equilibrium strategy that depends on the original polymorphism. Both these results confirm earlier conjectures concerning the application of evolutionary game theory to the repeated prisoner 's dilemma.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: C70, C72.}

Previous versions of the Folk Theorem have characterized only the payoffs of the game. This paper shows that over a finite portion of an infinitely repeated game, the concept of perfect equilibrium imposes virtually no restrictions on observable behavior. The Prisoner's Dilemma is presented as an example and discussed in detail.},
